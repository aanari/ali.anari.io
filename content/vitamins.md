**UPDATED: Mar 19, 2024**

A lot of friends and family members have asked me what vitamins and dietary supplements I take on a regular basis, so here's the latest list, broken down by time of day.

Shameless plug for my own supplement [Anari](https://anari.io), which has allowed me to consume 75% less caffeine than before.

I also recently started [Metformin ER](https://agelessrx.com/buy-metformin/) for the longevity benefits and [Tadalafil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadalafil) for leaner body mass and improved endothelial function, but please talk to your doctor first.
